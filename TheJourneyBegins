### Day 1: August 1
Finally made up my mind to actually "do" something rather than just glumping around.<br/><br/>
**Today's Progress:** Started freeCodeCamp's curriculum from #1~#14.<br/>
**Thoughts:** Feels good to start doing "something".  Will try my best to keep it going.  I have a long way to go in mastering the arts of using social media (aka tweeter; never thought i'd be using it) and still have no clue on how to use Github and freeCodeCamp LOL<br/>
**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp #1-#14](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
