# 100DaysOfCode - Done in 2018
A code newbie with a full time job challenging to code for the next 100 days!

### Day 1: August 1
Finally made up my mind to actually "do" something rather than just glumping around.<br/><br/>
**Today's Progress:** Started freeCodeCamp's curriculum and finished the "Basic HTML and HTML5" chapter!<br/>
**Thoughts:** Feels good to start doing "something".  Will try my best to keep it going but I have a long way to go in mastering the arts of using social media (a.k.a twitter; never thought i'd be using it) and still have no clue on how to use Github and freeCodeCamp LOL.  Overall thoughts for the coding in freeCodeCamp is that eventhough I pass the confirm stage, I seems like I'm only understanding 70%.  I'm confused if the blue letters within "" in the functions are critical values or whether I can change them if I want.  Better check this out.<br/>
