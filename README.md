# 100DaysOfCode - Done in 2018
A codeNewbie with a full time job challenging to code for the next 100 days!!

### Day 1: July 31, Tuesday
__*Finally made up my mind to actually "do" something rather than just moping around.*__<br/><br/>
**Today's Progress:** Started freeCodeCamp's curriculum and finished the through #1~#14<br/>
**Thoughts:** Feels good to start doing "something".  Will try my best to keep it going but I have a long way to go in mastering the arts of using social media (a.k.a twitter; never thought i'd be using it) and still have no clue on how to use Github and freeCodeCamp LOL<br/>

### Day 2: August 1, Wednesday
 
**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Basic HTML and HTML5" chapter and Enrolled in David J Malan's CS50: Intro to CS!<br/>
**Thoughts:** Overall thoughts for the coding in freeCodeCamp is that, eventhough I pass the confirm stage, it seems like I'm only understanding 70% of the concept.  I'm still confused if the blue letters within "" in the functions are critical values or whether I can change them if I want.  Better check it out.  As for CS50, sooo excited!!<br/>

### Day 3: August 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Trying to choose the concept for my CS50 problem set 0.  
**Thoughts:** For the problem set - So much to consider when choosing the theme (can't be similar to other peoples projects etc.).
**Link to work:**  Will upload soon.
