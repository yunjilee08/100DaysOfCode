# 100DaysOfCode - Done in 2018
A codeNewbie with a full time job challenging to code for the next 100 days!!

### Day 1: July 31, Tuesday
__*Finally made up my mind to actually "do" something rather than just moping around.*__<br/><br/>
**Today's Progress:** Started freeCodeCamp's curriculum and finished the through #1~#14<br/>
**Thoughts:** Feels good to start doing "something".  Will try my best to keep it going but I have a long way to go in mastering the arts of using social media (a.k.a twitter; never thought i'd be using it) and still have no clue on how to use Github and freeCodeCamp LOL<br/>

### Day 2: August 1, Wednesday
 
**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Basic HTML and HTML5" chapter and Enrolled in David J Malan's CS50: Intro to CS!<br/>
**Thoughts:** Overall thoughts for the coding in freeCodeCamp is that, eventhough I pass the confirm stage, it seems like I'm only understanding 70% of the concept.  I'm still confused if the blue letters within "" in the functions are critical values or whether I can change them if I want.  Better check it out.  As for CS50, sooo excited!!<br/>

### Day 3: August 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Trying to choose the concept for my CS50 problem set 0.  
**Thoughts:** For the problem set - So much to consider when choosing the theme (can't be similar to other peoples projects etc.).
**Link to work:**  Will upload soon.
<br/><br/>

### Day 4: August 3, Friday

**Today's Progress:** More freeCodeCamp and figuring out how GitHub works.  
**Thoughts:** After an hour of studying GitHub, I've got notta LOL.  A sweet fellow twitterer(?) told me there's a GitHub Tutorial.  Maybe I'll check it out.
<br/><br/>

### Day 5: August 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**   Continuing on the #freeCodeCamp curriculums.
**Thoughts:** Can't believe how good this program is.  It teaches you from the beginning and has reminders on the way to help those who are lost.

### Day 6: August 5, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  Not much today.  Made more ideas for CS50.
**Thoughts:**  Rather than jurassic world, maybe a more galaxy theme would be better.
<br/><br/>

### Day 7: August 6, Monday

**Today's Progress:** More #freeCodeCamp sets!  
**Thoughts:** It's getting harder to memorize the selectors.  Maybe a retry after the session is over.
<br/><br/>

### Day 8: August 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  Learned about the (computer's) priorities when setting colors etc.  Guess body << class << id << !important  LOL  and also learned about hex codes and RGB codes.  
**Thoughts:**  Interesting to understand the relationships between hex and rgb.  Love that coding is soooo clear compared to other fields.
